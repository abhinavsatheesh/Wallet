Wallet is open for any developers to lay their hands on, change any code, and to do anything else they want to do. But, I am strongly against anyone copying my Code, and proclaiming that it is theirs. Anyone can make any contribution to the project, but I will not be responsible for the code written by others. I will not be held responsible for any damages, or any other problems, that may occur from the use of other's code.

Please don't misuse this wonderful program, which can help many people.
